# Portfolio-page

Creating a portfolio page which meets the needs of an acceptance criteria.

## Technological features:

- We have used many of the elements we know about already.
- We used resizing features:
  - used the page wrapper class selector to ensure that we have a max-width
  - set flex-basis to 100% making the flex items the full width of their container. This therefore is making them take up the entire available width.
  - min-height 50px making a minimum height of 50 pixels for the first flex item.
  - targeting .her-banner centering the content both horizontally and vertically within the hero-banner element. This is done by using justify-content: center and text-align: center
  - targeting the .contact adress. Here we change the flex direction to column, this is how we stack the elemnts when its viewed in a mobile phone!
